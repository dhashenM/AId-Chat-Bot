This project was created as part of the Artificial Intelligence module coursework. The AI Chat Bot (AId) that converses with the user in natural language and provides assistance with regards to the course content of London Metropolitan university.
If you wish to exit the Chat Bot type "quit" and hit enter.
Ask or tell the Chat Bot anything you want. A few examples are 
hi,
